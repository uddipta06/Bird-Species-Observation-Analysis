This project focuses on analyzing the distribution and diversity of bird species across two distinct ecosystems: forests and grasslands. By studying observational data of bird species from both habitats, the objective is to explore how environmental factors—such as vegetation type, climate, and terrain—affect bird populations and their behavior. The analysis will aim to identify habitat preferences and examine how different ecological conditions influence bird diversity. The insights gained from this study can contribute to effective habitat conservation strategies, biodiversity management, and a better understanding of how environmental changes impact avian communities.
